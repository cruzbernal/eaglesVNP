JAGs code used by Cruz et al. (2018) 'Managing individual nests promotes population recovery of a top predator' Journal of Applied Ecology, 53:1418-1429.

The code describes an Integrated Population Model (IPM) evaluating the recovery of bald eagles in Voyageurs National Park 
during 1973-2016. The IPM integrates nest occupancy and reproductive output data to estimate nest-level probabilities of occupancy, 
nest success, and high productivity (producing ≥ 2 fledglings), as well as population-level estimates of abundance, growth, 
mean brood size, nest success rate, and productivity rate.
